Description:

UVA CS 3240: Advanced Software Development Techniques is a class that puts us through the software development cycle in the real world industry. In addition to learning each phase thoroughly, we are assigned groups to create a website to mimic how a dev team would operate. There were 5 positions, testing, requirements manager, scrum master, dev ops, and UX designer, and although each role were expected to contribute equal amounts, there are specialized duties.

My role: UX Designer

I was in charge of UX/UI Designs, including UX interview studies for feedback and overall frontend changes. I contributed code in all html files, as well as creating the majority of styles in css and scripts. Design wise, I created the logo, designed wireframes early in the ideation phase to see which methods work and don't.

Features added by me: Night mode that stores value on refresh Better UI for schedules and search Quality of life changes in response to user feedback, and suggestions for future features Icons for better understanding.
